# This is a workaround to add global Todoist shortcuts to WINDOWS 10

_Created by Rick Staa on 5/07/2017 - Version 1.0.0_

## Manual

Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesnâ€™t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a little workaround for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut.
This workaround works without "Autohotkey". But it is harder to install and can be slower than the AutoHotKey workaround.

### Instructions

#### _Preparation_

1.  Press the WINDOWS key.

2.  In the START MENU look for the Todoist program.

3.  Drag Todoist to the "TODOIST_VBS" folder.

#### _Add global shortcut to open Todoist_

4.  Left click on the _Todoist To-Do List and Task Manager_

5.  Set a keyboard shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcut" field.

#### _Add a global shortcut to open TODOIST and add task_

6.  Left click on the _script.vbs_ file.

7.  Click create a shortcut.

8.  Call the new shortcut anything you like.

9.  Left click on the Shortcut.

10. Set a keyboard shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcut" field.

11. Place the "TODOIST_VBS" folder in one of the following folders that are scanned by windows for custom user keyboard shortcuts.

    -   Desktop (C:\\Desktop)
    -   Start Menu folder (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu)
    -   Programs folder (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs)

#### NOTES

Don't change the name of the _Todoist To-Do List and Task Manager_ or the script will not work.
